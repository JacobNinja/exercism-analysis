Exercism Analysis Library
=================

# What?
The goal of this library is to provide a platform for running static analysis across different programming languages for [exercism.io](http://www.exercism.io)

# Why?
Static analysis is a cheap way of finding obvious structural issues with code. 
By combining strategies of linting and workflow analysis, this library provides suggestive feedback for improving code.
